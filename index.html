                    The earliest archaeological presence is considered to be around 2,200 years old. The Chola Dynasty had a prominent presence from 1014 to 1042 AD. The island was used as a naval base to launch expedition against Sriwijaya Empire. European colonization began when settlers from the Danish East India Company arrived here on 12 December 1755.

                    On 1 January 1756, it was made a Danish Colony and named “New Denmark”, which was later changed to Frederick's Islands. The islands were repeatedly abandoned during 18th and 19th century due to outbreaks of malaria. During World War II, the islands were under Japanese control for three years.

                    During this,the islands were renamed as "Shaheed-dweep" and "Swaraj-dweep". After Independence, it became part of independent India in 1950.It was declared as a union territory of the nation in 1956.

                    The people of Andaman and Nicobar are divided mainly into two categories indigenous tribal people and outside settlers. Both classes have different traditions and cultures, which creates a beautiful combination.

                    The indigenous tribes are mainly hunters or horticulturists and do not have much contact with outsiders. The present culture is mostly influenced by the outside settlers who have a high standard of living.

                    Literary art is not much prevalent in the region. There are many local authors and historians, who have produced many works but the same do not earn recognition.

                    Hence, efforts are being made to various mainland Indian writers to encourage art in the region.

                    The first every Indian Literature Fest was organized in October 2019, which concluded with humble requests and demands from the residents to continue the initiative. Many books have been written on the history and culture of the island by national authors.

                    The region surrounds some of the important facts not known to many. The archipelago is home to the only active volcano in India. It is home to the largest living arthropod in the world.

                    Baratang Island in Andaman is the only place in India with mud volcanoes. India’s first commercial seaplane was launched here. To preserve marine life, commercial fishing is banned in Andaman. The world’s largest sea turtle named ‘Leatherback’ is found here.

                    Tamil was once the widely spoken language, which is now a minority. The state symbol of the Archipelago is a sea cow named “Dugong”.
